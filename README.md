#Smart Glasses â€“ Embedded Systems Capstone Project
This repository contains the source code and documentation for the Smart Glasses project, developed as part of the University of Washington's EE/CSE 475 Embedded Systems Capstone course.

The Smart Glasses system is designed to assist users by capturing images and translating text in real-time. The key features of the project include:

- Image Capture: The glasses are equipped with a camera that captures images upon user input.

- Wireless Communication: Captured image data is transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a companion Android application.

- Text Recognition & Translation: The Android app uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from the image, translates the recognized text, and prepares it for playback.

- Audio Feedback: The translated text is sent back to the glasses, which then use a voice module to read the text aloud to the user.

This project demonstrates the integration of embedded systems, mobile development, and machine learning to create an accessible and user-friendly assistive technology device.
